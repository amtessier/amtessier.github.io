title: "Developmental trends and L1 effects in early L2 learners onset cluster production"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/TessierSDP2013
excerpt: 'This study focuses on English onset cluster production in spontaneous speech samples of 10 children aged 5;04–6;09 from Chinese and Hindi/Punjabi L1 backgrounds, each with less than a year of exposure to English. The results suggest commonalities between early L2 learners and both monolingual and adult L2 learners in the location of cluster repair and the sometimes-exceptional treatment of s+stop clusters. We also provide evidence that accuracy rates and repairs used in early L2 cluster production show L1 influences.'
