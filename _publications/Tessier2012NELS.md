permalink: /publication/Tessier2012NELS
excerpt: 'As a blend between serial and parallel phonological grammar, Harmonic Serialism has demonstrated some desirable advantages over classic Optimality Theory for capturing attested phonological typologies without overgenerating.  If HS is to be embraced as a theory of phonology, however, it must be associable with a working theory of learning. This paper is an initial foray into how difficult it is to learn the phonotactics of an HS grammar, and how these difficulties might in principle be overcome.'

As a blend between serial and parallel phonological grammar, Harmonic Serialism has demonstrated some desirable advantages over classic Optimality Theory for capturing attested phonological typologies without overgenerating.  If HS is to be embraced as a theory of phonology, however, it must be associable with a working theory of learning. This paper is an initial foray into how difficult it is to learn the phonotactics of an HS grammar, and how these difficulties might in principle be overcome.
