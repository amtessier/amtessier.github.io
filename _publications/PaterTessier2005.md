excerpt: ' Since Chomsky and Halle (1968), it has been assumed that an adequate theory of phonology should capture the connection between phonotactics and alternations by deriving them using a shared mechanism. In this study, we used an artificial language
learning experiment to test whether an alternation that meets a phonotactic target is easier to learn than one that does not. The two groups of adult subjects learned mini-languages
that differed only in whether the alternations were motivated by the phonotactics of their native language. The results suggest that phonotactic knowledge does aid in the acquisition
of alternations, and also provide a novel example of the influence of the first language on second language learning.'
