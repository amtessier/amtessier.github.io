title: "The Productive Status of Laurentian French Liaison: Variation across Words and Grammar"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Tessieretal2023
excerpt: 'This paper investigates prenominal liaison as it is used in contemporary Laurentian French, via an online production study that compares application of liaison in real vs. nonce nouns, We interpret our results as evidence that liaison behaviour is driven jointly by lexical representations and the abstract grammar, with properties of the real-word lexicon affecting the application of liaison to nonce words. We further show that there is considerable variation in the population in the extent to which speakers apply liaison with real h-aspiré words, but that all speakers nonetheless share an understanding of what types of words are more vs. less likely to undergo liaison.'
